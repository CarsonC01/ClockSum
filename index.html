        <p>ClockySum has one goal, to improve you or your child's multiplication skills.</p>

<p>The app definitely works! I asked my seven year old to try it. Her progress has been amazing, especially her confidence handling multiplication. Iâ€™m very happy with it and am sure you will be too.</p>

<p>Please spend, or ask your child to spend,  a few minutes working on ClockSum per day.  You will not only see improvements in your multiplication skills whilst playing the game, but will also notice a greater confidence and speed, whenever you are required to complete multiplication exercises.</p>

<p>The concept comes from a school teacher in the United Kingdom. He thought that this would be a fun way to learn math. Trying it out with children in his class on the white board he found that the children indeed found it fun. But he also found that the combination of the visual depiction of the math problem, the competitive nature of playing the game and the fun aspect, increased the students focus motivation and retention, giving them increased speed and confidence with these types of exercises.</p>

<p>Next steps: this is the first version of the ClockSum app. Depending on feedback we get from you and other of our valued customers we will add new features soon, for example: other types of sums, play against other children, set targets and win medals/reputation. Any ideas of feedback please contact me at: <a href="mailto:carsonc01@hotmail.com">carsonc01@hotmail.com</a></p>
