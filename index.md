A fast & fun way to learn addition and multiplication. 
 
The ClockySum Math method emphasises memory retention of fundamental mathematical skills. Using ClockySum you will instinctively know the answer, fast! 
 
It's very easy to use. Start with simple numbers and work through  the levels gaining confidence as you go. A settings screen allows you to adjust the course to your needs.

ClockySum is the idea of a school teacher from the United Kingdom. He thought that it would be a fun way to teach multiplication to the children in his class.  He noticed that the children were more motivated and enjoyed learning to add and multiply this way. He also found that their math skills improved quicker than when using traditional methods. 
 
This is the second version of ClockySum. We have now included Addition as well as Multiplication.

Next steps: this is the first version of the ClockSum app. Depending on feedback we get from you and other of our valued customers we will add new features soon, for example: other types of sums, play against other children, set targets and win medals/reputation.
